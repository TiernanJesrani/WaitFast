        Builds a rectangular locationRestriction based on the user's location and the provided maximum distance.
        
        The distance_max provided in the filters is in miles. This function converts miles to meters before
        applying the calculation. In particular:
            - If both distance_max (with or without an optional distance_min) is provided, the 
              maximum distance is used to compute a rectangular viewport.
            - If no distance_max is provided (even if distance_min is given), an empty dict is returned.
        
        Parameters:
            filters (dict): May contain 'distance_min' and/or 'distance_max' (in miles).
            user_location (dict): Contains the keys 'latitude' and 'longitude'.
